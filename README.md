# LoginForm
This project is a simple yet functional login form built using HTML and CSS. It showcases my ability to create clean, user-friendly interfaces and apply styling for a professional appearance. Although it doesn't connect to a backend in this version, it forms the foundation of how login systems work in full web applications.
